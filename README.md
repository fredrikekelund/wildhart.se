# wildhart.se

Website for the Swedish band Wildhart. Only CSS is used to achieve this, if I may say so, very dynamic and fairly interactive design. Well, besides [prefixfree](https://github.com/LeaVerou/prefixfree) and [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com), but JS libraries don't count in this contest, so I win anyway :dancers:

## Get started locally
The site can be served locally using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Keep in mind that on an Ubuntu platform, the package `ruby-dev` is needed to install the Jekyll gem. Then use `jekyll serve --watch --baseurl=` to get up and running!
