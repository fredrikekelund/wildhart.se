      quote: "There’s a certain attractiveness that comes with Swedish bands, and with Gothenburg-based newcomers Wildhart, we’ve our shining example, as their debut,”Stuck in a second”, shows they’ve a leg up on the rest of the world when it comes to electronic-pop"

      quote: "Wildhart is described as having their feet in jazz and improvisation music, and that’s certainly detectable on the heady, complex production and its enchanting, flittery atmosphere. There’s a future pop synthiness that evokes Purity Ring blended with Little Dragon, altogether paired with the icy, ethereal Scandinavian qualities of acts like The Knife, Oh Land, and Niki And The Dove."

      quote: Billed as “a fuck you to all the hardships that you carry inside when living in an patriarchic world, the new track is an intriguing, righteous purge that swells towards the kind of powerfully dynamic finale that the stifling patriarchy couldn’t even dream about. It’s a brilliant taster for the band’s new record.

      quote: It’s easy to get swept up in ‘Shake Off’’s bright sense of escape, but threading it together is a sense of resistance, defiance and positivity that Wildhart truly embrace

  title: Shake off highlights
  text: |
    Premiering initially on DIY (one of the biggest UK music sites/magazines), they said some really nice things - calling the track “a richly inventive new single” - describing it as "deep, exploratory pop.”

    We then followed that with some superb additional support from some big names, highlights including:

    CMU, who said: "It’s a high point from a wonderfully varied and adeptly fashioned album, which you should definitely set aside some time for when it comes out next month.”

    The Line Of Best Fit, who said: "Lead singer Ylva Holmdahl’s vocals start out reminiscent of Warpaint’s quiet determination, building to a climax over Josefin Runsteen’s frantic beats and hazy synths from Kiwi Berg.”

    GoldFlakePaint, who said: "Just as [Taylor Swifts] “Shake It Off” was rightly heralded as 2014’s gleaming moment of empowerment, so too Wildhart’s “Shake Off” deserves to reach as many hardened hearts and flailing limbs; the new track from the Gothenberg trio presenting an intriguing and thrilling burst of indie-pop, as vehement as it is danceable, that makes for the band’s most compelling moment to-date.”

    All Things Go, who said: "Their new single, “Shake Off,” borders on jazz, but brims with rock and roll attitude, slowly building into a rapturous anthem without ever revealing a chorus.”
